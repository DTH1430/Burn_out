        <h1>burnout isn't laziness.</h1>

        <p class="opening">
            Your manager doesn't know the difference. HR definitely doesn't.
            But since you're reading this instead of answering Slack, let's clarify.
        </p>

        <h2>what burnout actually feels like</h2>

        <p>You want to work. Your brain has simply unionized without telling you.</p>

        <p>You stare at your monitor with the intensity of someone who definitely knows what they're doing. Nothing
            happens. The cursor blinks. It's been three hours.</p>

        <p>Tasks you used to finish before your coffee got cold now require a meeting, two naps, and existential
            bargaining.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <p style="margin-bottom:0">You're still hitting deadlines. Technically. Through a combination of panic,
                caffeine, and whatever the
                opposite of work-life balance is.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Sleep doesn't help. Neither do weekends—those are just unpaid work anxiety with better snacks.</p>

        <p>You've started Googling things like "is it normal to feel nothing" during standups. It is not, but also,
            same.</p>

        <h2>what laziness actually is</h2>

        <p><span class="highlight-accent">Laziness is a choice.</span> A beautiful, guilt-free vacation from
            productivity culture.</p>

        <p>Lazy people don't spiral. They simply don't want to do the thing. End of story. No drama.</p>

        <p>They're not emotionally devastated that they haven't optimized their morning routine. They don't have a
            morning routine. They have mornings.</p>

        <p>Lazy people don't read articles about burnout. They're playing video games right now. Living their truth.</p>

        <p>Honestly? Aspirational behavior.</p>

        <h2>why they get confused</h2>

        <p>Both involve not doing stuff. That's where the similarity ends and the corporate gaslighting begins.</p>

        <p>Burnout is sneaky. You're still replying to emails at 11pm, so you must be fine, right? You're definitely not
            crying in a conference room. That's just allergies.</p>

        <p>The people who burn out are usually the ones who never took a lazy day in their lives. They powered through
            every cold, skipped every boundary, and called it "dedication."</p>

        <p>Calling burnout "laziness" is easier for everyone except you. It means the system isn't broken—you just need
            to try harder. Have you considered a productivity app?</p>

        <p>If trying harder worked, you'd be a CEO by now. Or at least not reading this.</p>

        <h2>what helps (and what doesn't)</h2>

        <p><strong>Doesn't help:</strong> #Hustle content, that one podcast about waking up at 4am, your company's
            wellness webinar, crystals, telling yourself to be grateful, comparing yourself to people on LinkedIn who
            are definitely also lying.</p>

        <p><strong>Might help:</strong> Doing less. Letting things fail. Accepting that your inbox will never be at zero
            and that's everyone's problem now. Talking to someone who responds with "that sucks" instead of solutions.
        </p>

        <p>Recovery isn't linear. You'll have one good Tuesday and immediately sign up for three new responsibilities.
            This is called "the trap."</p>

        <p>The goal isn't to return to your previous output. Your previous output is what got you here. Maybe aim for
            something sustainable, like "adequate" or "keeping it together."</p>

        <div class="closing">
            <p>Burnout isn't a failure of character. It's the predictable result of pretending you're a machine in a
                system that agrees.</p>
            <p>You noticed. That's the first step.</p>
            <p>The second step is probably also staring at this screen. That's fine. We can do this together, in
                silence, not making eye contact.</p>
        </div>
    </main>
